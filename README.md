# GreenCheap CMS

A modular and lightweight CMS made with Symfony and Vuejs components
GreenCheap works with PHP 8 version. In this case, lower versions of php will fail. If you want to try a lower version of GreenCheap version 2, you can access it [here](https://github.com/greencheap/greencheap/tree/2.1). But you need to know, GreenCheap version 2 is no longer supported.
