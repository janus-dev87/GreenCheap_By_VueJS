![GreenCheap](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwmejslx5/image/upload/v1599391312/greencheap/greencheap-wallpaper_j1glw0.jpg)

A modular and lightweight CMS made with Symfony and Vuejs components 

This version of GreenCheap is under development. It is not a stable version. So do not recommend using it. In this case, we recommend that you use the branch that supports [PHP 7.4](https://github.com/greencheap/greencheap/tree/php-7.4)

## Explanation

This project was taken from [Pagekit](http://pagekit.com). Dependencies of old packages that are no longer developed have been updated and shared with you under the name of **Green Cheap**. I also thank [Uatrend](https://github.com/uatrend/) for some addictions
