![GreenCheap CMS](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwmejslx5/image/upload/v1613331047/greencheap/heading-image_lenvxf.jpg)

A modular and lightweight CMS made with Symfony and Vuejs components

GreenCheap works with PHP 8 version. In this case, lower versions of php will fail. If you want to try a lower version of GreenCheap version 2, you can access it [here](https://github.com/greencheap/greencheap/tree/2.1). But you need to know, GreenCheap version 2 is no longer supported.

## Explanation

This project was taken from [Pagekit](http://pagekit.com). Dependencies of old packages that are no longer developed have been updated and shared with you under the name of **GreenCheap**. I also thank [Uatrend](https://github.com/uatrend/) for some addictions. We thank [Doruk Karaboncuk](https://github.com/Chaisser) for his material and moral support.
